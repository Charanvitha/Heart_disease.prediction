# Heart_disease.prediction
Overview

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes patient data and risk factors to determine the likelihood of heart disease. The implementation is carried out in Google Colab, leveraging its cloud-based resources for efficient processing.

Requirements

!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras

Dataset

Public datasets like UCI Heart Disease Dataset or Framingham Heart Study can be used.
Custom datasets can be created using medical records, ECG logs, or wearable device data.

Usage

1.Clone the repository (if applicable) or upload files to Google Colab.
2.Load dataset: Use pandas or numpy to read data.
3.Preprocess data: Handle missing values, normalize inputs, and extract features.
4.Train the model: Use pre-trained models or train from scratch.
5.Make predictions: Test the model on unseen data.
Visualize results: Plot graphs to analyze trends.

Eample Code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("heart_disease_data.csv")
X = data.drop("target", axis=1)
y = data["target"]
# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Predict
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
